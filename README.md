Technologies Used:
       We used UML, E-draw and Atom or sublime while we are designing our new system. The development tools that i will use are:
                 For the front-end application we used……. PHP.
                 For the back-end application we used……. MySQL database.
                 And we use Xampp server to configure a MySQL database and to use php applications for easy
                configuration and maintenance.
                 Server-side scripting: PHP
                 Client-side scripting: by considering the following characteristics we use java script. It can be
                embedded in HTML page and it is very popular in validation process.
                 for presentation……………. Power point and MS-word.
                 Static webpage: HTML is highly flexible with CSS to use different layouts

Roadmap and future enhancements:
        It is better to inform others who are interested to do on this project, the system doesn’t support: -
                 Grading (but, it can be integrated with SIS online portal).
                 Students who are not able to see (i.e. blind people).
                 Internet less services (i.e. its internet based).ability considerations.
